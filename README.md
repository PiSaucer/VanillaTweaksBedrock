## Getting Started

**Anyway to host a website**

Tools required:
- Web Browser
- Any method of hosting

Currently I am using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free and open source hosting.

### Customizing

1. Edit the files in `mcpack/master` and make changes in the `js/index.js`.
2. Create/Gather a bedrock texture pack
   1. I reccommend using [ModifiedCommand/ConvertJavaTextureToBedrock](https://modifiedcommand.github.io/ConvertJavaTextureToBedrock/) to convert Java Texture Packs into Bedrock.
3. To add new modules you could use the [converter](https://tweaks.pisaucer.com/convert/) that converts a bedrock pack into a html module (or do it by hand).
4. Add the files (unzipped) into the proper directory (`mcpack`).
